# Technical-PortfoliO
Welcome to the directory of all my programming and data analytics projects.

Each of the projects listed below was done for volunteering at the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, part of my MS Data Analytics Engineering curriculum at George Mason University, or from curiosity. 

The tools used to create these projects include: Python, Dash by Plotly, Git, SQL, noSQL, Pandas, Numpy, Geopandas, MatplotLib, Machine Learning, Scikit Learn, and many more. 

I am always learning and growing my foundation in programming and data engineering tool sets. 


## Flagship Project: 
#### Link2Feed project for the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina
  - Purpose: To determine Link2Feed system service gaps.
  - Method: python / Dash / Plotly / Folium / Pandas / geoPandas / Heroku
  - Repository: [Link2Feed Dashboard Repo](https://github.com/htwalden/Food-Bank-CENC-Link2Feed) 
  - Dashboard Website: [Link2Feed Dashboard](https://fbcencl2f.herokuapp.com)


## Analytics Projects:
#### Demographics Analytics for Food Bank of CENC 
  - Purpose: See how Food Bank agency reporting compares to Feeding America estimates. Ensure equitable food distribution and accurate reporting fro compliance. 
  - Method: python / Dash / Plotly / Pandas / Heroku / Jupyter Lab
  - Repository: [Dashboard Repo](https://github.com/htwalden/FB-FA-comparison-db) 
  - Dashboard Website: [FB vs FA Comparison Dashboard](https://fbfacompare.herokuapp.com)


## CLI Tool:
#### Inventory Reconciliation Program
  - Purpose: This project is a program that intakes serial numbers, validates them, and accounts for them. A report is generated at completion, and there is an option to save and continue progress from previous work. Enabled a co-worked to reduct inventory reconciliation time from 3 days to 6 hours. 
  - Method: python
  - Project Repo: [Inventory Program](https://github.com/htwalden/inventory_program)


## Machine Learning Projects: 
#### Predicting Winning and Losing Tennis Players with Classification Algos
  - Purpose: To determine if a player was a inner or a loser of a professional tennis match based on certain statistical match features. 
  - Method: python / scikit learn / pandas / numpy / matplotlib 
  - Project Repo: [Predicting Tennis Match Winners/Losers](https://github.com/htwalden/TennisProj)
  
  
## Custom Geolocator Tools:
  #### Google API geolocator:
  - Purpose: create a geolocator using the Google geolocator API to geocode addresses for the Food Bank PRoject. 
  - Method: python / Google geolocator API
  - Repo: [Geolocator Repo](https://github.com/htwalden/geolocators)
