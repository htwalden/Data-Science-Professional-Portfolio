# Technical-Portfolio
This is a directory of all my programming and data analytics projects.

Each of the projects listed below was done for volunteering at the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, part of my MS Data Analytics Engineering curriculum at George Mason University, or from curiosity and the desire to help others. 

The tools used to create these projects include: Python, Git, SQL, noSQL, Pandas, Numpy, Geopandas, Geoanalytics, Machine Learning, Scikit Learn. 

I am constantly learning and growing my foundation in programming and data engineering tool sets. 

## Flagship Project: 
### 1. Link2Feed project for the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina
  - Purpose: To determine Link2Feed system service gaps.
  - Method: python / Dash / Plotly / Folium / Pandas / geoPandas / Heroku
  - Repository: [Link2Feed Dashboard Repo](https://github.com/htwalden/Food-Bank-CENC-Link2Feed) 
  - Dashboard Website: [Link2Feed Dashboard](https://fbcencl2f.herokuapp.com)


## Machine Learning Projects: 
### 1. Predicting Winning and Losing Tennis Players with Classification Algos
  - Purpose: To determine if a player was a inner or a loser of a professional tennis match based on certain statistical match features. 
  - Method: python / scikit learn / pandas / numpy / matplotlib 
  - Project Repo: [Predicting Tennis Match Winners/Losers](https://github.com/htwalden/TennisProj)
  
  
## Analytics Projects:
### 1. Google/Apple App Store Project: 
  - Purpose: Compare data between the Google Play and Apple App stores to make a recommendation regarding the best genre in which to create a new 'free' app.
  - Method: Jupyter Notebook / python
  - Notebook: [App Store Project](https://github.com/htwalden/Data-Science-Project-Repository/blob/main/Free_App_Data_Project.ipynb)
### 2. Hacker News Post Analysis: 
  - Purpose: Analyze source data to determine when the best time to make a post is to capture the most comments.
  - Method: Jupyter Notebook / python / pandas / matplotlib / seaborn
  - Notebook: [Hacker News Project](https://github.com/htwalden/Data-Science-Project-Repository/blob/main/hacker_news_proj.ipynb)
### 3. Used Automobile Data Analysis:
  - Purpose: Explote data from German eBay auto site and determine which vehicle brands were most popular and which sold for the highest price. 
  - Method: Jupyter Notebook / python / pandas / matplotlib / seaborn
  - Notebook: [Used Automobile Project](https://github.com/htwalden/Data-Science-Project-Repository/blob/main/autos_proj.ipynb)
### 4. Interstate 94 Traffic Volume Analysis: 
  - Purpose: Determine what the greatest contributor to traffic volume is on the I-94 westbound lanes in St. Paul, MN, and make a recommendation on when the best travel times are. 
  - Method: Jupyter Notebook / python / pandas / matplotlib / seaborn
  - Notebook: [Interstate Traffic Project](https://github.com/htwalden/Data-Science-Project-Repository/blob/main/interstate_data_project.ipynb)


## Custom Geolocator Tools:
  ### 1. Google API geolocator:
  - Purpose: create a geolocator using the Google geolocator API to geocode addresses for the Food Bank PRoject. 
  - Method: python / Google geolocator API
  - Repo: [Geolocator Repo](https://github.com/htwalden/geolocators)
